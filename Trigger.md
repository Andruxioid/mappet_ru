Trigger is a component of many Mappet features which allow you to bind a sound event, a programmable event, a command and/or a dialogue. It looks something like this:

In this form you can edit:

* **Sound event** which will play a specific sound from Minecraft's sound system (meaning here you can attach either vanilla sound events, modded sound events or even sound events loaded from a resource pack)
* **Trigger event** which will execute a programmable event (pencil icon allows to jump to editing of such event, if it was created)
* **Command** which will execute a command
* **Dialogue** which will open a dialogue for the player (pencil icon allows to jump to editing of such dialogue, if it was created)
