Checker is a component (like [trigger](./Trigger)) of many Mappet features which allows you to program whether something should happen or not, i.e. a feature that lets you setup a condition under which it will work/be enabled. Checker is a hybrid that allows using either [expressions](./Expressions) or [condition editor](./Conditions).

The toggle button that looks like ðŸ”ƒ allows to toggle between an [expression](./Expressions) that can be typed in (or **Edited in fullscreen...** by right clicking the text field):

and a button that allows to open the [condition editor](./Conditions) modal:
