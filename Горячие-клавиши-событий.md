Event hotkeys is a special mechanism that allows to bind event triggering to a key. For example, if you want to make spells, you can create a couple of events and bind them to `Y`, `U`, `I`, and `O` keys.

## Editing

You can access the event hotkeys editor in [Mappet dashboard](./Mappet-dashboard)'s event editor panel.

Once you open the editor you would see this:

By right clicking on the left side of the modal you'd be able to add a hotkey. After adding, you can edit hotkey's properties. You can pick one key upon which an event will be triggered, you can pick an event itself, and configure an [expression](./Expressions) or a [condition](./Conditions) upon which event can be triggered.
