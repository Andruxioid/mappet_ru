Mappet dashboard is a special GUI screen which allows map makers to manage most of the features. Here you can edit: crafting tables, quests, quest chains, events, dialogues, region blocks, NPCs and factions.

It can be opened **by pressing** `=` key (by default) on the keyboard. If it doesn't open, check **Mappet dashboard** keybind for conflicts in Options > Controls.

## Managing data

On the right, in most panels for exception of region block editor, there is a sidebar that features a list of available data, 4 icons, search field and a text list.

In the search field, you can input some text that will try to match with list entries. By clicking on individual list entries you can pick an entry to edit in the main view in the middle. 

And with the four icons allow you to add (➕), duplicate, rename (✏️) and remove (➖). This should be self-explanatory.

There is also an arrow icon on the top left of the sidebar that allows to toggle visibility of the data list sidebar. Alternatively, you can press `N` on the keyboard to toggle visibility of the sidebar.
