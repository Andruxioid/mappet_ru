When updating, **make sure to back up your worlds**!

# `-dev1` to `-dev2`

## ðŸ”¨ Breaking changes

You need **to be aware of following changes** when updating from `-dev1` to `-dev2`:

* NPC ID was transferred to the state, so Matching NBT in kill objectives should be changed from `{NpcId:"%NPC_ID%"}` to `{State:{Id:"%NPC_ID%"}}`
* Most of the fields that accepted expressions were transformed into a hybrid between expressions and condition editor, so in case expressions went missing, you'll have to manually retype them from let's say `"dialogue_read(\"test\", subject)"` into `{"Expression":"dialogue_read(\"test\", subject)","Mode":1}` within JSON files.
* [Quest chain nodes](./Dialogues#quest-chain-node) now provide the ID (instead of NPC's ID or `[subject_id]`) that should quest nodes within a quest chain to [compare quest provider/receiver](Quest-chains#mechanics).

## ðŸ¥µ New features 

* Added [custom objective messages](./Quests#custom-objective-messages) to all quest objectives
